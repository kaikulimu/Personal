## TODO Terminology: PZoo = ?; Univ = University

## TODO Statistics
- TODO: Statistics on drawing a certain type of card, or its chance of showing up in your hand/display

## Over-the-Board vs [BGA](www.???.com)
- Two more sponsor cards TODO

## Resource Efficiency
- According to YouTube video ["How is Ark Nova balanced?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OTo1C7-OpM) by "Strategy Advisor":
    - 1 appeal = 3 money
    - 1 reputation = 3 money
    - 1 CP = 8 money
    - Animals with requirements are better because requirements lead to discounts
- However, his "1 appeal = 3 money" breaks even with an average animal having 1 animal icon and 1 continent icon, which means you get 2 icons for free. Therefore, small animals are generally better than large animals, especially in the early game where appeal is very important. Large animals usually have strong ability for late game, but is a waste of game for early game.
- Adjusted for above => **1 appeal = ~2.5 money**
- During early game, appeal is king. Pay attention to three watermarks:
    - 4 appeal or less: +1 appeal => +1 income
    - 16 appeal or less: +2 appeal => +1 income
    - 31 appeal or less: +3 appeal => +1 income
- Icon contributes to project => 1 icon = 3 point
- "Mini Project" Sponsor cards (e.g. `Penguin Pool`) => 1 icon = 2 point
- TODO Sponsor can do 0 money 6 appeal
- TODO Important to have 4-5 projects prepared, each is 0 money 6-15 points and free unlock map reward!

## Action Efficiency
> Roughly from best to worse
1. Association
    - Upgrade **early!** => Rush donation to hit PZoo/Univ CP track reward (Univ/PZoo are the best)
        - If you already have 1 CP, can also rush Assoc to gain 2nd CP
        - If you have an initial project with 3/4 CP, and Uniz/PZoo at 5-CP track reward
    - Upgrade => take 3rd/4th partner zoo for `partner zoo CP bonus` and/or `4th worker map CP bonus`
    - Upgrade => spend X tokens to double action (e.g. midgame Assoc 3+2, lategame Assoc 3+5)
        - Assoc 3+2 is very efficient compared to simply Assoc 3, like if you took 2 Univs early on
    - Upgrade => cheap donations (2/5 spots are excellent; 7 spot is decent)
2. Sponsor
    - Upgrade => Play upgraded sponsors
    - Upgrade => "Break 7 Gain 14" especially if you gain an upgrade before 1st break
    - Upgrade => spend X tokens to double action
3. Animals
    - Upgrade => Animals 5 gives 1 reputation
    - Upgrade => Play Level 2 animals
    - Upgrade => Animals 3 can play two animals
4. Cards
    - Upgrade => Draw strong cards from display
    - Upgrade => To have more than 9 reputation
    - Recommended to move back for X token
5. Build 
    - Upgrade => Efficient building with kiosk/pavilion
        - It's only slight money/appeal advantage; not essential if something else is more urgent
    - Upgrade => Bird Aviary
    - Recommended to move back for X token
    
- TODO At around 30 appeal, skipping upgrade to go for one more project is preferrable
- TODO How much value does an upgraded action actually give you?
    
- IMPORTANT: Before you do an obvious Action, think about if other actions would make more sense, esp. if you have X tokens
- TODO Explain “take actions at Strength 5, but here are the exceptions”
- You prefer to take a “priority action” more than once before break, so you can play it at a lower strength
    - e.g. Association 3 for PZoo when you have two workers
    - e.g. Sponsor 4 for sponsor card when you have two good sponsor cards to play
- TODO [Pat Schooley] You can play 2 sponsors before first break, but likely 1 Assoc and 1 animal, so prioritize Sponsor action

- TODO How to decide which to upgrade first???
- Default upgrade order: Build -> Animals -> Cards -> Association
    - If you upgrade Sponsor, then most likely give up Association
    - Reasons to upgrade differenly
        - Assoc early => Rush donation to hit PZoo/Univ CP track reward
        - Sponsor early => Gain early income when you low on money
        - Sponsor early => Big three sponsors: `Explorer`, `Talented Communicator`, `Science Lab`
        - Cards early => On Commercial Harbor
    - Reasons for non-standard give up:
        - Cards: if you have unlocked snapping map bonus *and* are high unlikely to reach more than 9 reputation
        - Build: if you have unlocked 2-size map bonus *and* will build 4/5 for large animal
            - Beware of having enough empty spaces. Rule of Thumb: Should upgrade Build if you played 2+ Sponsor enclosures
        
TODO theory: don’t have inefficient turns, that’s why you Break 7 Gain 14 money       

TODO theory: Usually you need to support at least 4 projects to win 
        
TODO: to count which actions will come up next after a sequence of actions, say them out loud. (Reference the actual game) For example, the desired sequence is Sponsor 3 Side Entrance -> Build 2 -> Assoc 4 2-rep Univ -> Cards 5 -> Sponsor 4 Archaeologist -> Build 4 -> Animals 5
- Example game: ??? Move ???
- Say out loud “Sponsor, Build, Assoc, Cards”, and you know Sponsor will be strength 4 again, followed by Build at strength 4

## Action Sequencing
TODO Explain why you would do Cards before Assoc Round 1 when Australia PZoo has small chance of being stolen

## Card Draw Chances
- There are 128 animals + 64 sponsors + 2 BGA-only sponsors 20 non-base projects = 214 cards in the BGA deck
    - BGA-only sponsors are "Victory Column" and "Arcade"
- Number of cards per icon:
    - Bird:             25 animals, 4 sponsors    13.55% or 1/7.5
    - Herbivore:        25 animals, 4 sponsors  
    - Water:            23 animals, 6 sponsors
    - Predator:         25 animals, 3 sponsors    13.08% or 1/7.5
    - Reptile:          25 animals, 3 sponsors    
    - Rock:             19 animals, 5 sponsors    11.21% or 1/9
    - Primate:          18 animals, 4 sponsors    10.28% or 1/10
    - Non-base project: 20                         9.35% or 1/11
    - Petting Zoo:      10 animals                 4.67% or 1/21
    - Bear:              9 animals, 1 sponsors        
> See "ark_nova_draw_chance.py" for calcuations
- Display replenish 2 cards chance to get:
    - Bird, Herbivore, Predator, Reptile:  ~25.76%
    - Primate:                              20.22%
    - Petting Zoo, Bear:                     9.47%
- Draw 3 cards chance to get:
    - Bird, Herbivore, Predator, Reptile:  ~36.03%
    - Primate:                              28.74%
    - Petting Zoo, Bear:                    13.87%
- Draw 4 cards chance to get:
    - Bird, Herbivore, Predator, Reptile:  ~44.88%
    - Primate:                              36.35%
    - Petting Zoo, Bear:                    18.05%
    
- *Lemma* -- Snapping a specific card > hope drawing it
- *Heuristic* -- draw icon chance increase per draw
    - Bird, Herbivore, Predator, Reptile:   12.00%, "Weight" = 1.125
    - Primate:                               9.00%, "Weight" = 1.5
    - Petting Zoo, Bear:                     4.50%, "Weight" = 3
> "Weight" refers to the difficulty of drawing a specific icon
- *Examples*:
    - If you already have one Petting Zoo, getting 2 more Petting Zoo has Weight 3 * 2 = 6
    - If you already have one Primate, getting 4 more Primates has Weight 1.5 * 4 = 6
    - If you have no Bird, getting 6 more Birds has Weight 1.125 * 6 = 6.75
    - *Aware* If opponent is fighting for the small icon, the Weight doubles
        - Therefore, easier to achieve secret Rhino project than a public project
- *Key Insight* -- Choose the goal with the lower Weight!


- TODO Probability(showing up before game end) == ??
    - TODO How many cards we draw in one game?

## Icons
- Bear > Bird > Herbivore > Predator > Reptile > Primate > Petting Zoo
- There are **no** primates in Europe nor Australia
- Water > Rock because there are simply more water icons in game

## Continents:
- Asia > America > Africa > Europe > Australia

## Starting Hand
- TODO Watch video by NoWondersTV
- TODO Keep cards in starting hand: near good > future good
- Keep at least one project if possible

## Cards
- TODO
- **Don't sabotage yourself** trying to deny your opponent. It's rarely worth it.
- *Lemma* -- Snapping a specific card > hope drawing it
- Don't be afraid of discarding cards. Discarding a card is worth ~2.5 money, but playing a more optimal card can easily outvalue 2.5 money
- When looking at cards on display, *also* consider what your opponent wants
- Which display cards do you pay attention to? Those that match with any of the projects. Don’t tunnel-vision on a single project
    - Projects cards are the rarest => worth snapping if it matters to you or your opponent
    - Also good synergies cards like `King Vulture`
- TODO don’t just think about what you want; deny important cards of your opponent! Even do Upgraded Cards 3 for this!
- Don't touch the display if you don't have to -- you might give your opponent miracle out!

## Build
- TODO
- Kiosks are overrated; you only need 2-3 kiosks per game
- Try to build Bird Aviary and Reptile House near both rock and water
- Bird Aviary > Reptile House
- When playing Side Entrance, you still want to have efficient actions. Try not to waste too much time doing Build 1
- At around 30 appeal, **do not** build kiosks anymore! Would rather have a 2-size enclosure just in case

## Animals
- Overpowered: Rhinos > `Sun Bear` > Eagles > Elephants
    - But don't blindly keep Rhino! `American Bison` on a 5-CP America project board is better than a Rhino
- Attack: Hypnosis (late game) > Pilfering (early game) > Constriction (late game on Association) > Venom (mid game)
- Petting Zoo animals are below average, unless there is `Species Diversity` project
- If you plan to play two animals, remember to play the Sunbathing one first
- TODO: Always pay attention to rock/water requirements, especially double

## Sponsors
- Adapting from YouTube video  ["Ultimate Ark Nova Sponsor Cards Tierlist by JDansp"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxaWdKL-kA), strongest sponsors are:
    - Overpowered: `Archaeologist` > `Federal Grants` > `Technology Institute` > `Side Entrance`
    - Always nice: `Hydrologist`, `Geologist`, `Science Library`, `Zoo School`, `Expert in Asia`
    - Two appeal per icon is high value! `Aquarium` > `Penguin Pool` > `Meerkat Den` > `Cable Car` > `Baboon Rock`
    - Map shape abuser: `Native Farm Animals` > `Native Seabirds` > `Native Lizards`
    - Reasons to upgrade Sponsor: `Explorer` > `Talented Communication` > `Science Lab`
- TODO If you played Side Entrance, embrace large animals
    
## Association (TODO Theory vs Strategy/Practical)
- Unlock Map Bonus Priority:
1. Association Worker
2. Snapping
    - Unlock Snapping before Assoc worker *only* if you can break soon this round and gain another worker by next round
    - Don't need if there is a "buffet" -- an abundance of icons for project(s)
3. 5 money
4. 2-size enclosure

- TODO **Important**: Decide between which to unlock first

- Common ways to gain 2nd worker:
1. Unlock worker map bonus (via Assoc 5)
2. Have 8 reputation
3. Play `Talented Communicator`
4. Play Full-throated animal
5. Have 2 CP 

- TODO When do you need 2nd and 3rd worker?

- Try to rush 1-3 early projects at 2 CP, then focus on getting 4-5 CP projects
- Pay attention to synergy for early Release project, Breeding Program project, `Small Animals` project, `Research` project, and `Aquatic/Geological` project
- If you happen to do project at Round 1, consider gaining Snapping (map bonus) + Worker (CP track) or Worker (map bonus) + Upgrade Sponsor (CP track)

- Look for opportunity to block Univ > block partner zoo

## How to read your opponent 
TODO (NoWondersTV video, pilfering monkey from PZoo, X-back Assoc/Build implies don’t want break, draw 3 means bad hand or don’t want anything display card or sunbathing (??)

## Opening Theory
- Don't always be afraid of opponent taking your desired Univ/PZoo. Should go for highest EV play
- If you need to play a 3-Rep requirement sponsor, such as `Penguin Pool`, two Univs can help you
    - 2-Rep Univ get you to 3-Rep, obviously
    - 5-hand Univ also works if you can build covering 1 Rep or play 1 Rep animal.
        - Replay example: https://boardgamearena.com/table?table=484430916 Julie (144#) vs kaikulimu (125)
    
## Endgame
- Play **FAST!** in the endgame. Skip any action that give you less than 6 average points...
    - Sponsor 7 Break 7 if you need to!
    - "Prioritize quick development. Sacrifice a few points if you have to."
- Think **consection actions!**. Do not waste a single turn
- TODO Consider how to maxmize all sponsor endgame bonuses, and compare with what your opponent can get
- TODO How to calculate how will the game end?
#### Number of Rounds before Game End
- Most likely 5-6 rounds totals
- Point, income at each break (assuming 5 breaks):
    - point: 0  10  30  60  100
    - income: 16  24  32  40  48
    - If there are 6 breaks, most likely the first two breaks combined lead to \{point = 0, income = 16\}
    - Sponsor X Break X generally lead to higher total number of breaks
- Hence, start thinking about endgame at around 60 appeal, or 50 appeal if you have two big projects
    
## When to Cause Break
Three primary factors:
- Money & income
- Association workers left & action position
- Number of cards in hand; pay attention to 5-hand-size Univ

## Tips
- **Always Remember!** Margin of victory is slim. Analyze and play your best every move!
- TODO How PZoo/Univ reward on CP track affect things (like early upgrade Assoc)
- Build 1 for kiosk/pavilion looks cute, but is *very* inefficient
- When Clever is good, it's very good. When Clever is bad, it's very bad.
- Usually, you play Side Entrance as "Main Entrance", where you build next to existing buildings in order to gain more income
- Beware of 41 CP and 113 appeal max limit
- Beware of Sunbathing if opponent suddenly draws lots of cards
- Think about what your opponent will likely do on their turn too, e.g. when considering who might cause break and discard cards
- Set an objective of next few turns so you don't forget what you want to achieve
- Watching streams/replays from top players (e.g. JDansp) help a lot

## Map Guide
> Reference: ["#1 Ark Nova Player Map Ratings and Tips (JDansp /w Darcelmaw)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCQwYeEdd7o)
1. Silver Lake
    - Start near the lake
    - Archaeologist for reputation usually
    - Determination is the most overpowered map bonus during late game
        - Thus, save for it when unlocking map bonuses
    - `Free-Range New World Monkeys` very good on this map
2. Rescue Station
    - Start near a digging spot
    - Build towards other digging spot, so you can dig ASAP if an important card shows up on display
    - Dig icons which match projects
    - Can dig large Herbivore for Flocking potential
3. Outdoor Areas
    - Start near free partner zoo spot
    - `Archaeologist` is extremely overpowered, because you gain 3 partner zoos for free
    - Cute play: Gain 3 partner zoos in Round 2 to gain 2nd worker
    - It's okay to cover one "Outdoor Areas" spot to play Aquarium on bottom right
    - Aviary is less valuable because you aleady have "Outdoor Areas"
    - Large animals requiring rock is weaker, because there is one spot to connect rock to "Outdoor Areas"
4. Research Station
    - Start near free Univ spot
    - Or start near "Research Station"
    - Optimal play: Association 3 for partner zoo in Round 1, then build on free Univ spot in Round 2. Difficult for opponent to block Univ
    - Petting Zoo is better on starting hard for covering Univ spot
5. Commercial Harbor
    - Start near "Commercial Harbor"
    - Consider upgrading Cards early to sell more cards
6. Ice Cream Parlors
    - Start near a parlor spot
    - Or start near two reputation spots
    - Bad map for `Aquarium`
7. Hollywood Hills
    - Start near 5 money/reputation/sponsor card spot
    - Okay to upgrade Association if you have covered some sponsor card spots, but have not drawn an upgraded sponsor card
8. Park Restaurant
    - Start near "Park Restaurant"
    - Building spots are tight!
9. Geographical Zoo
    - Start near whichever continent you plan to play animal next
    - Try to connect to the middle of the map quickly, so you gain access to all continents
    - Generally, gain 2 appeal is the best continent bonus; sometimes Clever can be crucial
10. Observation Tower
    - Start near "Observation Tower"
    - Worse map because rock and water are highly separated => very inflexible
