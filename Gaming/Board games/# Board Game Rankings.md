# Board Game Rankings
- Criteria: Strategy, immersion/theme, analysis, snowbally and gameplay/balance list


## Three Laws of Board Game Design
1. *Balanced*: Well-balanced because of game design, regardless of the differing strengths of every card
2. *Replayable*: A variety of opening situations where you have to play differently to adapt
3. *Friendly*: High skill, moderate luck
	- Friendly to stronger players -- they can win in the long run
	- Friendly to weaker players -- sufficient luck such that they can beat stronger players from time to time
		- Chess is a counter-example, where if you play someone weaker you win 95%+ of the time

## Tier 0
