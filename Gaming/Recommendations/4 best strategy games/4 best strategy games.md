Very deep strategic game. You will improve as you play and that feels great! Very interesting mechanics and lots of ways to approach the game effectively.

#### Pros:
- Lots of ways to approach the game strategically. You can either kill a guard, KO a guard, or evade the guard.
- Alarm level raises each turn, which disencourages turtle-style slow play. Improvement over XCOM: Enemy Unknown.
- A large part of the fun is choosing the most optimal location for the next mission, both in terms of time efficiency (travel time) and what your team needs.
- Each character has unique abilities; some are quite interesting.
- AP and power management.
- Good storyline and ending twist!
- Cannot exploit save-load

#### Cons:
- In Endless mode, you get almost full build at around Day 8, and the game gets boring after that because choosing location doesn't matter much anymore.
- To exploit sprinting when encumbered, you need to drop and pick up one item every turn, which gets tedious.
- If you make one big mess up, your whole gameplay could be over, as there is no save-load exploit.
