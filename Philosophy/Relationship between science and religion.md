# Relationship between science and religion

## Bridge and Car
Science is the bridge on which all religious cars drive on, so I cannot accept any religion which fundamentally breaks science.

## Poker AA Theory
Why are you so lucky and get dealt AA in Poker?
- Science "bridge": Your hand is a result on *starting deck state* -> *hand motions in shuffling*. No randomness.
- Buddhism "car": You plant some good seed, so you get rewarded with AA.
- Atheist "car": It is variance. This hand I am lucky to have AA, but later I will be unlucky and have 72o.
